oh-my-zsh-danlinn-theme
=======================

This repo contains a theme called danlinn that combines
the Powerline-like agnoster theme and the multi-line 
duellj theme and includes a battery display script 
(adapted from Steve Losh's) that shows 
charging/plugged-in (not charging) and the charge level.
Includes the mensch-powerline font for fancy symbols.  

Install (this assumes that you have the original 
oh-my-zsh installed):

Put the themes/danlinn.zsh-theme file in your oh-my-zsh
themes folder. (Mine is at ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/)

Install the font

Symlink or whatever the batterycharge.py to 
bin/batterycharge.py and add execute priviliges to it

Switch your font to mensh

Enjoy
